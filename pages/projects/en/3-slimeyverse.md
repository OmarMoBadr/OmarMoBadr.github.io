A little game made inÂ the **Global Game Jam 2022** theme was: **Duality**

<br>
## Idea

you play as a slime that can split itself into small slimes

and you can also switch the world and there you can shoot slime balls

### Note: this is just a prototype of the game we plan to update it to improve visuals and add more levels and mechanics and a lot of bug fixes.
