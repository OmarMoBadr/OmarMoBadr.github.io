a Mini game where you play as a deer exercising on an UNSTABLE treadmill that is changing its speed unpredictably, made for Ludum Dare 49 and the theme was (Unstable).

![gameplay](/assets/projects/dear/gameplay lowres.gif)

tools:
- Pygame - framework
- Aserpite - pixel art
- Bfxr - sound effects
- Audacity - making music  

The game was made in 48 hours using Python with the module Pygame and my small engine.

## how to play

![instructions](/assets/projects/dear/instructions.png)

you have to match your speed to treadmill's speed using **Space Bar** but if you slipped you will have another chance to get high score by dodging clouds in sky using **WASD**


## results

my entry this time did better than the last one although the game didn't come out as I planned because I wasn't able to utilize all my time during the jam, after all it was a great experience as always.
