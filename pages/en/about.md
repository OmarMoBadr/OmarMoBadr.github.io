description: I'm a Self-Taught software developer I have experience working in ["Python","C#","C++","JavaScript","GML"]. I like to develop systems for video games because I think that developing games is the most interesting thing about software engineering. Also, I do work on making other projects like Web and Desktop Apps and Automation scripts.
I would like to share in this Blog some tips about Productivity and Programming that I collected along the way in my journey of learning how to code.
